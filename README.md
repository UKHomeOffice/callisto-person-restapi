# Callisto Person REST API

## Building the project

### Github Package dependencies
In order to pull in Github package dependencies you will need a Github Personal Access Token.
This token will need the minimum of 'packages:read' permissions.

Update your .m2/settings.xml file to contain the <servers><server> tags like timecard_settings.xml
The token will need to live within your local .m2/settings.xml file as the password

Then run the following to build the project

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```
